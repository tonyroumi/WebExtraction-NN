# Neural network for Web Extraction
This project aims to harness the power of neural networks to facilitate web extraction tasks, making the process more robust and efficient.

This was inspired by Tomas Gogar(B), Ondrej Hubacek, and Jan Sedivy, reimplemented for article extraction.

## Overview
In the realm of web automation, building and maintaining web scrapers is a tedious task. The dynamic nature of the web necessitates constant adjustments to scraper algorithms, often requiring human intervention. Scalability is also a significant challenge.

This project seeks to address these challenges by leveraging machine learning techniques, specifically neural networks, to automate and optimize the web extraction processes. By training a neural network model on a diverse dataset of web content, I aim to create robust and dynamic scrapers capable of handling various websites and adapting to changes over time.
